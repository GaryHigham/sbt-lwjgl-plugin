## New Settings in LWJGLPlugin

* `lwjgl.org` setting is available, and now points to `org.lwjgl.lwjgl`
* `lwjgl.nativesName` setting is available, and now points to `lwjgl-platform`
* `lwjgl.utilsName` setting is available, and now points to `lwjgl_util`

## Backward compatibility notes

`resolvers += "Diablo-D3" at "http://adterrasperaspera.com/lwjgl"` has been removed.
This means that the plugin now pulls from maven central.
