* `LWJGLPlugin` can now handle multiple versions
* `JMonkeyProject` can now resume nightly downloads

## New Settings in LWJGLPlugin

* `lwjgl.org` setting is available, and now points to `org.lwjgl.lwjgl`
* `lwjgl.nativesName` setting is available, and now points to `lwjgl-platform`
* `lwjgl.utilsName` setting is available, and now points to `lwjgl_util`

## Updates about updating

Updating to the latest version should be as easy as changing the
plugin's version in your `plugins.sbt`. When in the sbt console, run
a `clean`, to remove the old lwjgl natives. 

## Backward compatibility notes

`resolvers += "Diablo-D3" at "http://adterrasperaspera.com/lwjgl"` has been removed.
This means that the plugin now pulls from maven central.

For forward compatibility's sake, the Macintosh OS is now identified as `osx`, instead
of `macosx`.
