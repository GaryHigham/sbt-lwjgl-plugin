- `LWJGLPlugin` properly handles older versions
- `JMonkeyProject` now handles new directory structure
- jMonkey downloader reports progress [#24](https://github.com/philcali/sbt-lwjgl-plugin/issues/24)
- slick2d pulls proper lwjgl version [#25](https://github.com/philcali/sbt-lwjgl-plugin/issues/25)

## jMonkey Notes

Now that the jMonkey team has a public maven for their releases, use the
`JMonkeyProject` settings only if you want to build against nightly.

## Notes about updating

Updating to the latest version should be as easy as changing the
plugin's version in your `plugins.sbt`. When in the sbt console, run
`clean`, to remove the old lwjgl natives.
