sbt-lwjgl-plugin
================

This is a simple plugin for sbt specifically for [LWJGL] projects. The idea was taken from this
post by [Death by Misadventure].

Usage
---

In your project, create a plugins/Plugins.scala, whose contents are as follows:

    import sbt._
    
    class Plugins(info: ProjectInfo) extends PluginDefinition(info) {
        val sbtLwjglRepo = "sbt-lwjgl-repo" at "http://scan.github.com/maven"
        val sbtLwjglPlugin = "com.github.scan" % "sbt-lwjgl-plugin" % "0.3.0"
    }

How it works
---

The plugin adds the necessary dependencies for LWJGL to your project. On `run`, the downloaded natives are extracted to the lib directory, the `java.library.path` is set correctly.

The plugin comes with a Slick2D trait for [Slick] dependencies.

Example Project Definition
---

Here's an example project definition:

    import sbt._
  
    class ExampleProject(info: ProjectInfo) extends LWJGLProject(info) with Slick2D {
    }
