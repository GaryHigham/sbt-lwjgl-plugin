# sbt-lwjgl-plugin

This is a simple plugin for sbt specifically for [LWJGL] projects. The idea was taken from this post by [Death by Misadventure].

Please visit the [wiki] for more info, roadmap, etc.

**Note:** This plugin was recently migrated over to sbt 0.10, so project migration 
information will trickle in slowly.

## Usage

In your project, create a project/plugins/build.sbt, whose contents are as follows:

    libraryDependencies += (sbtVersion) { sv => 
      "com.github.philcali" %% "sbt-lwjgl-plugin" % ("sbt" + sv + "_3.0.4")
    }

**Or**, you can make use of the giter8 template, to kick off your project.

    g8 philcali/lwjgl.g8

Once you answer all the appropriate questions, you will have a lwjgl project in awaiting.

## How it works

The plugin makes use of public maven repo found at the LWJGL wiki. It pulls the dependencies, and extracts lwjgl jar to your working lib directory.

**Note for Slick Devs**: You may have to run update twice. The second time will patch an ivy dependency xml to pull the correct phys2d jar.
